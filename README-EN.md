# MP3 Player (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§)

Vous pouvez retrouver ce fichier en [franÃ§ais ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·](README.md)

Satunes is a mp3 player on Android. Use it to listen your music from your audio files stored in your Android phone (Android Lollipop 5.1.1 and later).
This application is still in development and contains bugs and bad ui.

This entire project is under GNU/GPL v3 and it's applied on all versions of this project (even the code pushed from the very first commit.).

If you decide to use my code to create new app, you can but you have to use the same license :p
