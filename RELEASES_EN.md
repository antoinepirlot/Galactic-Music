### 0.8.1-beta

Improvements, Optimizations and Troubleshooting:

* When the user has added music to playlists but decides to delete them from the device, the
  application deletes missing music from playlists. This prevents the application from crashing
  every time you launch it.
* The update system has been redesigned. Now the user needs to click a button in the settings. This
  is no longer automatic in order to avoid unnecessary data consumption.
* Update checking has been fixed and now takes into account 4 types of updates:
  * Alpha: These are the most experimental and buggy versions. Features are not set in stone and may
    disappear with a subsequent update.
  * Beta: These are test versions to resolve problems with new features. This will be permanently
    added to the application (except in cases of major forces).
  * Preview: This is a release candidate which, if all goes well, will be deployed as a stable
    version.
  * Stable: This is a ready-to-use version. This is the recommended version for normal use. However, it may still present some bugs but these will be fixed
     rare and will not prevent the functionality from functioning properly.
* Adding music to several playlists is basically fixed.
* Crashes occurring when recomposing the UI following changes such as "Screen rotation" or "
  Activation of dark mode" will no longer cause the application to crash.
* The navigation has been corrected, now the user can return to other main screens from the settings
  following a recomposition of the screen as indicated in the previous point.
* When launching the application, it should no longer crash due to problems related to playback
  initialization.
* The data structure has been revised to resolve certain problems such as opening an album that was
  not the correct one or causing the application to crash when 2 albums have the same name.
* Optimization of data loading as well as the change of random mode (thanks to Kotlin coroutines).
* The progress bar has been collapsed on the sides to avoid conflict with gesture navigation.
* Playback in Android Auto has been fixed. This will result in a possible increase in battery usage
  but this has not yet been verified.
